My role as volunteer coordinator plays a key role in making sure a strong volunteering culture exists within clubs. My focus is on ensuring that everyone who volunteers at the club feels valued, developed, and supported and has the confidence and knowledge to undertake their roles to the best of their ability. I also lead the recruitment of students for new and existing roles within the club.
Volunteer coordinator benefit clubs by:
- Breaking down volunteer roles into smaller roles or tasks
- Acting as a designated person to support volunteers.
- Helping increase the number of volunteers.
- Ensuring volunteers feel valued and supported.

### Activities under my leadership at APMS:

I recruited a group of students who are willing to help the community. We participated in the Alzheimer‚Äôs walk because we want to increase awareness for Alzheimer‚Äôs care. We volunteered at Ronald McDonald House Charities of Western New York. Buffalo Ronald McDonald House is a place where focuses on ‚Äúkeeping families close‚Äù by providing free lodge support for families of children receiving medical treatment in Buffalo. With our care, we can cook a meal for guest families at the House and make them feel at home. We also participated in the National Multiple Sclerosis Society for Monster Scramble 5K/10k event, to bring up attentions for Multiple Sclerosis and to cheer for the event participants who succeed until the end of the trail. On the same hand, we are involved in the 716 Ministries construction projects. We helped to renovate the future medical center in downtown Buffalo. Not only that, but we also volunteered at the Western New York Food Bank. We saved more than 300lbs of food for people who need it. This position as a volunteer coordinator helped me build up my leadership skills in teamwork. Even though I graduated from the University at Buffalo, my passion for volunteer services remains undiminished.

What an amazing summer? A lot of my first time were given to my lovely campers. 

First time staying in a summer camp, especially MDA summer camp.

First time staying without any mobile devices.

First time having ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù pranks on my face.

When I miss them, I will check out this full of good memory video.

I‚Äôm a self-motivated international orientation leader at the University at Buffalo. I assisted international students to feel welcome to a new country and culture. I helped bridge the gap for individuals like me, who experienced unfamiliar environments upon their initial arrival to the United States. Due to my outstanding work as roving photographer during the International Student Welcome Series (ISWS), I was nominated to be the ‚ÄúHumans of Buffalo‚Äù on the International BULLetin Spotlight Newsletter in 2019.
